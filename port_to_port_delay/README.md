A YANG model for stochastic port-to-port delay of (wireless) TSN bridges, modelled as histograms.

This model is part of Deliverable D3.4 "Report on Optimized Deterministic End-to-End Schedules for Dynamic Systems", published on the [DETERMINISTIC6G web-page](https://deterministic6g.eu/). Please have a look at this report for further explanation of the model.
